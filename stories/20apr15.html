				<h4>04.20.15</h4>
			</br>

				<p>I called the school and cancelled my application.<span class="self-talk"> Are you crazy?</span></p>

				<p>Do you mean that not having future commitments is crazy? I like crazy. I actually cancelled all future commitments.</p>

				<p><span class="self-talk">How about your future?</span> What future? Ha! Exactly.</p>

				<p><span class="self-talk">What are your family and friends going to think about this? </span> Of course it matters what they think but what matters to me is that they cared and I am grateful for it. If they really cared&hellip;</p>

				<p><span id="dropcap">F</span><span class="small-caps">or the past years I&#39;ve been carefully placing </span>my cards for a &ldquo;better and secure&rdquo; future. Looking back, I have no regrets and things fell in place as what they are suppose to be. It is not because of my awesome planning which mostly never worked anyway but things just kind of happened. Actually I do have regrets. I am glad they became regrets. Now I have to make sure that they don&#39;t become future regrets. I made quite an amount of mistakes. Now I have to make sure I make more mistakes by trying not neglecting.</p>

				<p>I decided to pack my bags, start the next chapter, and hit the road again. This past road trip has been fun and staying in an apartment for 2 months made me realize that the world is still huge to see.</p>

				<img class="photo-landscape img-responsive" src='img/solvingProblems.jpg' alt="Working on Data Science Problems">


				<p>Staying is not bad at all. I had a lot of time to think, ponder into my thoughts, and discover new inspirations and experiences. I was able to work on my projects that I could not have done on the road due to lack of resources. I actually considered staying here for an entire year. Oh and I met a single mother who is letting her son to learn whatever he is curious about, very inspiring. Curiosity and intuation is a huge part of the Jump Out 2.0, inspired by this amazing mother.</p>

				<p>See puzzles are piecing together. Since I am focusing on my instincts, it seems that there is nothing for me here.</p>

				<p><span class="self-talk">Haven&#39;t you jumped out already? </span>Well, that was a mini lazy jump. For most people around me, it was a real jump and I thought it was too at that time. Before I quit my job, I have declared a game to myself called &ldquo;How far can you go?&rdquo; . I applied and got accepted for admission to a school where they are reinventing education and I could meet the kind of people that I wanted to surround myself with. Technically, it does align to my goals from previous years until now but after riding coast to coast, there is something else missing that the school cannot provide. What is it? I have no idea. I may have looking into this in the wrong angle. It is a good thing that the school didn&#39;t start early and kept moving dates. It has allowed me time to think and look into where I am heading.</p> 

				<p><span class="self-talk">How about feel? </span>I honestly I have neglected that again for the longest time. It seems right but didn&#39;t feel right. I think I was really focused which turned half-blind along the way. This is where the momentum for the real jump is. On my past career, or life, I had strong instincts fighting me where I have ignored. One day, I was fully motivated to get things done. Suddenly, after I sat on my desk, there is this feeling of something has left me (literally). Followed by a loss of motivation and emptiness. But that was just an only a small piece of misery that I felt at that time. A huge part of it is the kind of people around me (cynic and neglectful), different story.</p>

				<p>Now, I have 2 years left to live. I have cancer. Why not fully jump? I have no clue what is on the other side. No one has a clue on what is on the other side, as much as they want to predict. Looking around me, it is quite wasteful to be an &ldquo;adult&rdquo;, making excuses, and rationalizing to make themselves feel better or special. This is comparing to my circumstances. Well, taking off excuses is supposed to be a one-size fit all anyways. You have to make a choice.</p>

				<p>Now, for all I care, I&#39;ll just keep playing.</p>

				<p style="text-align: center;">*Raises hand, chest level*</p>

				<p style="text-align: center;">&ldquo;Quest, on!&rdquo; loudly said.</p> 

				<p style="text-align: center;">*Notebook with quests for the next chapter pops out*</p>

				<p style="text-align: center;">See what I did there? That is intense imagination.</p>

			<p>An old friend, whom I have not seen for years, has been offering his place in Philadelphia to stay. He owns a small organic farm. These past weeks I am looking into organic food which aligns to my current goals. I am also experimenting/redesigning my lifestyle for more energy throughout the day. My previous practices have worked well for me before, since circumstances have changed like my workout needs a good pad, laptop battery, supplements, unemployment, etc. I am surprised myself that there could be a more versatile and efficient way. If it worked well, I don&#39;t have to worry about looking for places to do my workouts, food can suffice my supplements, travel anywhere, and it fits my budget.</p>

			<p>By the time that I fully understand this framework, I could possibly enable other people.. the right ones.</p>

			<p>He has laid back roommates, hosts for international guests, and they are overseas travellers too. I have been warned that I might like it over there. I am already sold but I wouldn&#39;t be so sure at the moment. I am only planning to stay for a month. Honestly, I think this is where I need to be.</p>

			<p>Next on the path in this chapter, Alaska&#39;s nice weather is around June to September. I could make the trip after meeting the team.</p>

			<p>There is nothing on the list after that.</p>

			<p>Flipping on side quests, long term related. I&#39;ll still be working on learning Data Science and might start reopening iOS application development.</p>

			<p>If I ever made the trip, I&#39;m going to balance it. All this time I thought apartments are strict on monthly payments, good thing I learned that there are weekly ones. Maybe I would do 1 week on the road and wilderness then 1 week in an apartment or 2:1. It would be nice to be indoors from time to time just to cave in, sleep in a real bed, keep learning programming, and the actual time to sit down and write my thoughts and experiences throughout the trip.</p>

			<p><span class="self-talk">Sounds like you planned it.</span> Not really. When I cancelled on my school I sat down and thought about the things that I am working on. Philadelphia and Alaska randomly popped in my mind. So I started asking my friends some questions. Turns out, it felt like a puzzle piece that fell into place. So I decided to head there and play.</p>

			<p><span class="self-talk">What if things didn&#39;t turned out as you expected?</span> That is what Alaska and eating fresh salmon for. If things go bad, salmon makes the tummy happy. Whatever that means.</p>

			<p><span class="self-talk">Did you say you have cancer?</span> I declared that I have cancer and I only have 2 years left to live. Just go with it. We are adding constraints to make it more fun.</p>
