			<p>&ldquo;Yes, I just said fuck that!&rdquo;

			<p><span class="self-talk">What is up with the profanity?</span> I am frustrated. I&#39;ll tell you why.</p>

			<p><span id="dropcap">T</span><span class="small-caps">he only time I&#39;ve been writing is in school.</span> All those time I&#39;ve been writing in school is not just to learn but also to get the fuck out of this subject and move on. Yes, I approached learning the wrong way. We are told to write about something I don&#39;t give a damn about. We are told to read a book of specific genre and write a report with certain number of pages for introduction, body, and conclusion. Did I have a choice? I did. I could have written whatever and however I wanted and took the same writing class again. No child want to spent the rest of their school year taking the same class, losing summer break, and being left out from the batch they originally started with. I started to blog not only to share stories &amp; lessons but also to practice how to communicate my thoughts. But the habits of worrying about technicalities and forms bugs me; I was overthinking it and forgot to express myself.</p>

			<p>No, I am not going to blame school. Back then we are only focused on following a set of rules. I am not going to blame myself either for not trying in the past. I didn&#39;t know any better. Now I do. I&#39;m glad that is fucking over.
			</p>

			<p>Lets play a game. It is called &ldquo;Fuck it, just write it&rdquo;. Here are the rules:</p>

			
			<ul style="list-style:none; text-align: left;">
				<li>Use proper grammar to the best of your ability. No, &ldquo;who I is&rdquo; please.</li>
				<li>Try you best to convey your ideas clearly.</li>
				<li>Express yourself.</li>
			</ul>
			</br>

			<p>Take off all other technicalities, rules, and form. You are not writing to please anyone, to be somebody else, and for a grade. Oh I forgot #4   DO NOT LOSE YOURSELF. 
			</p>

			<p><span class="self-talk">Wait, at some point you are going to find a job. What if people or employers see this?</span> If you are going to hire me or be around me, it will not just because of my skills or profession, you are also investing in my personality to add into your culture. You can&#39;t just say, &ldquo;I only want a janitor, not an introvert&rdquo;. Well you can&#39;t have one or the other, it is a package deal. Employers should start seeing people as people not just manpower. With that being said, I&#39;m not going to wear a different mask for money and I&#39;m not going to be unreasonably belligerent either. That shit tiring, inauthentic, and pointless. I can handle and express myself just fine.  Looking for the right people is not just about academic background, work experience and skillset but also their perspective and personality. This goes along with choosing friends or the people you surround yourself with.</p>

			<p><span class="self-talk">Do you need a hug?</span> Damn it! Give me that hug!</p>

			<p>I apologize with all these profanity. I have these several posts that I was excited to write about. Every time I start, these academic habits of writing keeps pulling me into writer&#39;s block. Maybe it is that or putting pressure to myself. I am aware that I don&#39;t have much writing experience and I am not mad about that. I am mad about that I&#39;m starting lose the sense of who I am if I kept trying to write like when I was in school.</p>


			<p style="text-align: center;">***End Rant***</p>

			<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em;">Let&#39;s write!</p>
