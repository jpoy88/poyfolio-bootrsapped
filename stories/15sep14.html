				<h4>09.15.14</h4>
			</br>
			<p><span id="dropcap">A</span><span class="small-caps">fter a year and a half of stressful work, I decided to take 6 days off work.</span> Since it was summer and I still work in Turkey, why not see the party city of Turkey, Alanya. All I wanted to do is relax, drink, and take photos. Little did I know there is something more valuable than pampering myself.</p>

			<p>I did a bit of research on how to get to the place. There is a shuttle service that I found online paid for pick up. When I arrived Antalya airport, I waited a few minutes for my shuttle. One of the local bus drivers said, &ldquo;Ride? City Center&rdquo;. I replied, &ldquo;I want to go to Alanya&rdquo;. He carefully explained, &ldquo;I drop you off the middle of highway, cross other side, wait for the Alanya bus to come&rdquo;. 
			</p>

			<p>I stood silent for a bit and thought about it. First of all, I have an English-speaking shuttle, which is about to come. Second, I don&#39;t trust strangers that much. Third, I understood what he said but it was hard to picture so it is a bit confusing to me. Last, I have 6 vacation days so if I got lost on the first day then I have 5 more days to find my way home. The risk is high and the cons are not brutally bad. I decided to ride in the bus and played with uncertainty.</p>

			<p>While my mind was wandering, the bus driver told me to get off the bus and cross the bridge to catch the Alanya bus. Oh boy, I am really in the middle of the highway and I don&#39;t have any instincts at the moment. I saw an overpass, crossed it and waited patiently. 
			After a few hours the bus to Alanya came. 
			</p>

			<p>I arrived to Alanya and started to look for the hostel. On the way to the hostel, there is this guy yelled from his vehicle &ldquo;America! Wooo!&rdquo;. I smiled back and made me think because there is no indication that I am American. I am Asian with a blue backpack. Maybe it is the way I walk.</p>

			<p>I finally found the hostel and the receptionist gave me a map of Alanya. A map at last! There is no way I am going to get lost. </p>

			<p>First in the agenda, go up the mountain and take a panoramic photo of the area at sunset. I hiked up and it was no joke, pretty damn far. I found my spot and took photos. It was really dark when I finished.</p>

			<img class="photo-panorama img-responsive" src='img/alanyaOverlook.jpg' alt="Cleopatra Beach in Alanya">

			<p>There are no shuttles going down the mountain at that time which left me no choice but to walk. While I was heading down, I found a Russian mother and daughter fellow tourists. I told them while passing by, &ldquo;Amazing view that way&rdquo; pointing to the direction where I came from. They pointed to the direction where I came from and said, &ldquo;Go down&rdquo;. &ldquo;Nope, that is the way up. This is the way down&rdquo;, I replied. They pointed again on the same direction, &ldquo;Down&rdquo;. &ldquo;This is the way to go down. You can come with me. Your call&rdquo;, I offered. They both hesitated. I can see and understand that it would be crucial for them to trust anyone at this moment. You are a tourist and lost in a pretty dark mountain, of course everything can easily go wrong. Honestly, I would not trust anyone and find the way myself. Just me.</p>

			<p>They agreed and started to walk with me down the mountain. We exchange names (which now I forgot, I am terrible with names anyway) and salutations. The daughter kept telling me that her mother is very nervous. I reassured them that they are safe with me and I know the way down. On the way down, we took several stops for photos and they wanted me to get in the photo.</p>

			<p>I tried to have a photo with the two of them but the mother rather takes her daughter&#39;s picture and me. Oh well, we can have all good souvenirs.</p>

			<img class="photo-landscape img-responsive" src='img/girl.jpg' alt="On our way down the road.">

			<p>As we press on our walk down the road, there is wreckless driver that passed us by. The music is loud and I saw a bunch of guys in it. They suddenly stopped for a few seconds. Then they hit the road again. All I can think of that moment is &ldquo;Thank God, I&#39;m with them. What could have happened if they were alone?&rdquo;. They must have only saw the ladies before they decided to stop because I was walking in front. After a few miles, we made it to the market place and club area. The tourists are familiar with this place. They thanked me and we parted ways.</p>

			<p>After a few days of walking around, going to clubs and having several drinks I decided to find Ataturk&#39;s House. The place is inside somewhere in the city but I am really optimistic that I can easily find it. I was lost, tired, and hungry. I wondered if I could really find this place. Nearest food I can get my hands on at the moment is Baklava. Its a desert but the sugar and calories will keep me going, oh joy. I asked the shop owner about Ataturk&#39;s House and pointed at the map (a vector illustrated kiddie map). It is either he had no clue what I am trying to say or he doesn&#39;t know where the place is.</p>

			<p>Luckily there were kids playing nearby and the younger generation where taught English. These four 2-5 year old kids decided to take me on walk to the place. It is funny how there are no guardians around for these kids. We went on a mini adventure passing through backyards (it felt like trespassing). Ataturk&#39;s House was like 5 blocks away from where I was and I don&#39;t think I am going to find this place without these little adventurers. (Yes, I should have took a photo of them)</p>

			<img class="photo-landscape img-responsive" src='img/AtaturkPalace.jpg' alt="Ataturk&#39;s Palace.">

			<p>I went inside and met the housekeeper. He asked me if I am Filipino. I am surprised because only a few Turkish people know what a Filipino is. I mean this is not a territory that my people would live. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, I replied. He told me to look around first then we will talk after my tour.</p>

			<p>I went back to him and he excitedly picked up the phone. He talked to someone and gave me the phone. It was his Filipina daughter-in-law. We talked a bit and shared experiences. She originally lives in Holland, married a Turkish man, and visiting Alanya for a while. I wasn&#39;t able to see her face to face because her husband is not around, we are just giving proper customs to the culture. I thought about how much connection you feel when you talk to a stranger who shares the same culture in such a distant place. The housekeeper was also excited to build that connection as well.</p>

			<img class="photo-landscape img-responsive" src='img/AtaturkHousekeeper.jpg' alt="The housekeeper and Me.">

			<p>There was other little delights in my journey alone in Alanya but these experiences that I shared caught me off guard and became memorable. If I stuck with my original plan, I am more likely missing these spontaneous opportunities. You find a lot of valuable things or experiences in detours than the destination itself.</p>
